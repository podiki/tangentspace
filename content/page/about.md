### Brandon Anderson

A native Montanan, Brandon thrives on open space. He spent his early years mounting wilderness expeditions from his home in the hills outside of Helena, and nursing an addiction to speculative fiction. Anything to make the world feel bigger. Unwilling to stop at our planet, he studied astrophysics at Montana State University, and went on to receive his PhD in Santa Cruz, California. He continued, studying dark matter as a postdoc, for four years in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently on a physics hiatus, he is finally making his own science fiction.

### John Kehayias

John is a New Yorker by birth, though his family is from Greece and Korea. While he appreciates a beautiful landscape, most often John can be found in larger cities. He studied mathematics and physics at Columbia University in New York City before enjoying sunny California for graduate school (in the same cohort as Brandon). Afterwards he spent three years as a postdoc in Tokyo, Japan, followed by two years in Nashville, Tennessee. Life has since moved on from theoretical physics, and John is currently pursuing many interests, from essay writing and photography to coding.
