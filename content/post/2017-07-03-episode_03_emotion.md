We really go off on some...tangents in this episode. While we start with a discussion on emotions and AI inspired by a sci-fi book trilogy, we quickly find ourselves talking about decision making through coin flipping, random numbers, and why we're probably living in a simulated reality (maybe). We had a lot of fun in this one, while including some science and math (it's in our nature, apparently). Check out the episode, with a few show notes below on the full post.

The book we mention that begins our discussion is *Ancillary Justice*, by Ann Leckie. It is part of a trilogy (*Ancillary Sword*, *Ancillary Mercy*) which both us (and several of our friends) greatly enjoyed. The plot and world are intriguing, different, and part of a well written complete story. With giant spaceship AIs, a galaxy spanning civilization built on conquest and assimilation, action, and introspection, it is definitely worthwhile reading. We highly recommend both fans of sci-fi and those with just a passing interest to take a look; we think you'll love the series as well.

We also mention the reality questioning Benford's Law, which you can read about [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law). It is thoroughly weird and thought provoking. We may take a more detailed look in a future episode.
