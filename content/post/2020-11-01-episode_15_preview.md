We're hard at work on the next episode, but wanted to remind everyone in the US to vote! Rather than just record ourselves saying "Vote!" and loop it, we present to you a special preview from our upcoming episode on the anti-superhero shows *Watchmen* and *The Boys*. Or more like a random tangent that may get buried in editing. Consider this fair warning to catch up on watching before the episode comes out.

Get it while it's hot! And vote! (And if you can't vote, pray and/or sacrifice to your favorite god.)
