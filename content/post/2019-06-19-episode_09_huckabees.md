Catching up on another episode we are proud to present the last of the single digits, immortalized as an episode about...well, immortality! Even better, it is longer than the usual!

We debate the joys and pitfalls of being immortal and whether anyone would really want to live forever. Speaking of forever, sorry this episode languished a bit in editing and posting (*cough* John *cough*). It has been so long this show notes writer (*cough* John *cough*) is having difficulties remembering what we discussed. So this website writer (*cough* John *cough*) is left without much to go on. I suppose he could blame someone else (*cough* Brandon *cough*), but since he does all the hard editing work...

Anyway, elves, lobsters, memory, being trapped in a computer, AI...consider it a surprise and enjoy the extended episode on the player below, or your favorite podcast app. Links and credits on the full post.

After we recorded this episode, an [article in the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/opinion/why-mortality-makes-us-free.html) looked at the morality and purpose of mortality in religion and philosophy.
