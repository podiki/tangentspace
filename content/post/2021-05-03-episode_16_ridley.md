It's like they made a TV show for Tangent Space: sci-fi with androids, some post-apocalyptic faraway planet, monsters, gibberish science...that's right, we discuss HBO's *Raised by Wolves*! Oh, and longtime Tangent Space personality Ridley Scott is involved (in the show, not with us), of course, so you know we couldn't pass this one up after we've discussed *Prometheus* and *Alien: Covenant* extensively. It's a throwback to the very first episodes!

There's a lot to talk about here with ancient religion, a cross over with *Star Wars* (hi, Darth Vader), giant snake worm things, and that bonkers season finale. Come have a listen and look below for show links...
