Another episode for ya!

We discuss imitation, fakery, memories, and the downfall of reality as we uncover more of our deepest fears. But it's not all dark! Learn how a bag of chips will protect your identity, how videogames will allow us to replicate Brandon, and about that childhood movie that actually doesn't exist.
