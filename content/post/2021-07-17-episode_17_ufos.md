Tangent Space faces reality in this one folks. Or as close of an encounter as we can get. Which of us has seen a UFO in real life? Why would Brandon only be convinced aliens exist if they demonstrated their power? Does John want to join a UFO cult? Find out answers to these questions as we shill for alien sponsorship! We discuss the big questions, wondering if we are alone, if anyone would even believe if aliens showed up, and how to pronounce "fata morgana." We also watch some UFO videos (links below!) and start down the path of alien conspiracies. 

Join us, little green friends! Have a listen and look below for show links...
