Just two men watching boys (and grownups) wearing masks and punching people. We discuss two very entertaining and pertinent shows, *The Boys* on Amazon and *Watchmen* on HBO, which we highly recommend. We cover a lot of stuff in this one, from masks and being anonymous, to policing, race, privilege and encryption. It's not all serious of course, as Brandon reveals his love for Wonder Woman and his distrust of tall people. Meanwhile John continues throwing shade at J.J. (Abrams) and wonders about Lube Man (answer down below!).
