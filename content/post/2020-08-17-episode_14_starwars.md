Many stars, many wars, but only one podcast episode. We take a meandering look at the religion/fandom/industry/empire that is *Star Wars*. Somehow we remain mostly spoiler free, though we jump between all the movies (even the unmentionable ones) and even a little of the games. John throws some shade on J. J. (Abrams) while Brandon falls for the wookies and their trees and champions robot rights. We coin (discover?) the term "robophobe."

Ducrossy folks, most ducrossy.
