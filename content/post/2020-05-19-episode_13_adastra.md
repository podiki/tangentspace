Nothing like a timely movie discussion, but at least we made it in under a year since the movie was out! We discuss *Ad Astra*, the recent movie with Brad Pitt and his space dad, Tommy Lee Jones. Lots of space in this movie dear listeners: space action, space psychology, space family drama, space monkeys! Also, moon pirates. It is most certainly not all fun and games, as the movie explores what it means to dedicate yourself to science, the exploration of other life, and the role of family. While the movie is quiet and contemplative, we'll make up for it with our yapping. Skip to about 7 or 8 minutes in to avoid overall plot spoilers, though we still discuss parts of the plot throughout.

*Correction*: we were a bit optimistic of the ethics in science, but alas primates are still used in research. Some laws to reduce experimental usage are progressing and great apes are banned in many countries, but not the US.
