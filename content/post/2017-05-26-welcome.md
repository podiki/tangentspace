Hello and welcome to our (Brandon and John's) brand new podcast! This is the official website for everything Tangent Space. In addition to posting each episode here, we will also put up some extras, announcements, and occasional blog posts related to the podcast. You can read a little bit about us on the [About page]({{< relref "about.md" >}}).

Some of the content is still being finalized, but please enjoy [Episode 1: Prometheus]({{< relref "2017-05-26-episode_01_prometheus.md" >}}). All of our episodes will appear on our [SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/tangentspace) and very soon on Stitcher, iTunes, and wherever podcasts are found. You can get in touch (for now) via the email and Twitter links at the bottom of every page.

Thanks for joining us, much more soon!
