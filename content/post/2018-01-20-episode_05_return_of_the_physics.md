You just can't keep us away: in this episode we talk physics, but only the fun and cool stuff! Inspired by a question from a student, we discuss some of our favorite and most mind blowing topics we learned about during our time as physicists. We talk about the true weirdness in the quantum world, the ultimate fate of the universe, and come up with a potential new name for the podcast. Episode and links below.
